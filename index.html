        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><strong>PrimeFaces Extensions project</strong> is a community driven open source project which has an aim to be a
            lightweight and fast JSF 2 component library in additional to <a href="http://www.primefaces.org">PrimeFaces</a> - a
            rapidly evolving component set and more. We are big fans of PrimeFaces. This project is an extended component set with
            useful components missing in other JSF 2 libraries or with improved components which already exist somewhere but don't
            work there smoothly. It only uses standards and is highly compatible with existing JSF 2 frameworks. We use one of the
            best JavaScript framework <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> behind the scenes with its amazing widgets, plugins,
            themes and Ajax interactions. We avoid on purpose other JS / UI frameworks in order to have a high compatibility
            between components.</p>

        <p>PrimeFaces Extensions is an open source project licensed under Apache License V2. The CKEditor add-on, like the CKEditor itself, is distributed under the GPL, LGPL and MPL.</p>
